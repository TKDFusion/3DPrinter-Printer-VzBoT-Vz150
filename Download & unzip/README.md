# Unzip files
Due to the large file sizes of the project, all files need to be compressed a great deal to be able to upload them to github.

Amongst zipping the files it was needed to eliminate some hardware and threading in order to reduce file size enough, this does have the added benefit of better loading performance in most CAD software!

To unzip the .7z files you will need to download and install 7zip on 7-zip.org (https://www.7-zip.org/).
