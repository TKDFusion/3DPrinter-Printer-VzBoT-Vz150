Notes:
  -Left side has a X limit switch stopper. Be careful on the assembly, the smooth idlers go with the "S" mark under each part, and the toothed idlers go with the "T". The smooth idler side has a 0.5mm offset in X direction to align with the rear motor pulleys on the Vz330. So be careful when you assemble them to avoid missalignment.
